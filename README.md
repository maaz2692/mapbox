Mapbox Project Navigator

Author: Maaz Mustafa

Version: B

Mapbox Project Navigator is a modern, interactive web application built to display real-estate project details using Mapbox GL JS.
This project provides a seamless experience for users to explore properties, view high-quality images, navigate between project pages, and interact with an embedded dynamic map powered by Mapbox.

The system fetches real project data from JSON sources and displays information such as:

Project images

Location coordinates

City, province, and project metadata

Detailed project pages

SVG-based custom map markers

Using Angular’s modular structure, the application ensures fast loading, smooth routing, clean UI, and maintainable code architecture.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.5.

##Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd your-project
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
